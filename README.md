# MedSegFormer: Spatial-Channel Hybrid Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation

MedSegFormer is a spatial-channel hybrid transformer designed to improve medical image segmentation, especially in pathology and radiology integration. It addresses several key challenges in medical image segmentation, including robustness across diverse imaging modalities, handling class imbalances, and reducing the dependency on large annotated datasets. MedSegFormer introduces a hierarchical transformer architecture that integrates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance both global contextual understanding and fine-grained feature refinement.

## Overview
Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in healthcare by enabling precise delineation of anatomical structures and pathologies, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, current methods often struggle with diverse imaging modalities and class imbalances. MedSegFormer overcomes these limitations by leveraging a novel hybrid transformer architecture:

- **Spatial Attention**: Captures global contextual information.
- **Channel Attention**: Refines features for better segmentation performance.
- **Dynamic Refinement Strategies**: Mitigates issues like class imbalance and image quality variations through adaptive weighting, multi-scale iterative refinement, and uncertainty-driven learning.

## Features
- **Spatial-Channel Hybrid Transformer**: A transformer model that integrates spatial attention for global context and channel attention for feature refinement.
- **Dynamic Refinement**: Techniques like adaptive weighting, multi-scale iterative refinement, and uncertainty-driven learning improve robustness across diverse datasets.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance on benchmark datasets compared to existing models.
